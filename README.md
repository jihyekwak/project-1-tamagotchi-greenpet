Project one - Tamagotchi

My tamagotchi pet is plant. Player can give water, sunlight, and proper temperature with buttons.
If the plant pet does noe get enough water, sunlight or the temperature is not proper to grow plant, the plant pet die.
If the player gives enough water, sunlight, proper temperature to the pet plant, the plant grows well and blooms flowers.
If the temperature is too cold or too hot, the plant can't bloom flowers.
